A simple video searching application built using packedobjectsd library. Searcher program sends broadcast request to clients including video title, expected price and its id. Each client will then check on its video database for the movie and match the price from search request. If the movie exists and the price less than or equal to the search price, it will reply to the searcher with its own id, video title, price and searcher's id. The searcher program then reads the reply message if it matches its id.

To run the program, first compile and install the packedobjectsd library using autoconf tools and then make in examples/video-0.2 folder. First run the video_client program then run the video_searcher. The search request details can be altered by modifying search.xml file.
