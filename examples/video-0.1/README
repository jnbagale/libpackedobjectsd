A simple video library system using packedobjectsd library. The server broadcasts new video release information to subscribed receiver at default frequency at the begining. The searcher can change broadcast frequency of the server at run time. All three server, searcher and the receiver will init_packedobjectsd using the video.xsd schema. The searcher will send search.xml to the server with broadcast frequency which the server will process and it will send some/all of the data from video.xml to the receiver.

To run the program, first compile and install the packedobjectsd library using autoconf tools and then compile this program using autoconf tools. video_searcher, video_server and video_receiver can be run in any sequence but running video_server, video_receiver before running video_searcher is recommended.
