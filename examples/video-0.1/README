Video example version 0.1

A simple mobile search program for video data built using libpackedobjects and libpackedobjectsd library. The responder will init_packedobjectsd using the video.xsd schema and PUBLISHER flag. The searcher will init_packedobjectsd using the video.xsd schema and the SUBSCRIBER flag. The video data is in XML format and will be encoded using libpackedobjects with the help of XML schema before being sent to the searcher.

 In this version, PUBLISHER and SUBSCRIBER flags are used instead of RESPONDER and SEARCHER flag as the searcher will receive video data from responder without sending any search requests. The responder sends video data  to the searchers at pre-defined frequency. The searcher just displays the data as XML without processsing it. A single searcher can receive data from multiple responders and also a single responder can send data to multiple searchers.

To run the program, first compile and install the packedobjectsd library using autoconf tools and then compile video-0.1 using autoconf tools. Run video_searcher and then video_responder.
