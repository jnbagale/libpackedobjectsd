A simple video library system using packedobjectsd library. The server broadcasts new video release information to subscribed receiver. The searcher initiates the server with required configuration such as broadcast frequency. All three server, searcher and the receiver will init_packedobjectsd using the video.xsd schema. The searcher will send search.xml to the server with configuration settings which the server will process and it will send some/all of the data from video.xml to the receiver.

To run the program, first compile and install the packedobjectsd library using autoconf tools and then make in examples folder. simple_searcher, simple_server and simple_receiver can be run in any sequence but running simple_server, simple_receiver and then simple_searcher is recommended to avoid losing messages at receiver.
