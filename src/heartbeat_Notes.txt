How to store heartbeat? 
    heartbeat variable 0 and 1.
    query_broker_heartbeat();

Issues!

1. Subscribers won't receive HeartBeat unless there is a publisher running or a broker is already registered for the schema.
   It should work w/o any publisher as it is sent by broker.
   Linked to Subscribers not being able to start brokers!

2. Subscriber and Responder using same port and broker. Should be separate ones to avoid issues.


init_packedobjectsd: set pod_obj->heartbeat = 0; // -1 means no heartbeat will be received

packedobjectsd_receive:  sets pod_obj->heartbeat = 1 

60 seconds 
query_heartbeat_broker --> reset pod_obj->heartbeat = 0;
Where?
