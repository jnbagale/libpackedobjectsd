@section What is libpackedobjectsd?
@cindex What is libpackedobjectsd

libpackedobjectsd is a light-weight XML messaging library. It is created using multiple publisher and subscriber model and built using libpackedobjects and ZeroMQ in C language. It is simple to implement and is suited to embedded systems and mobile devices. The library provides simple API to send and receive XML data to and from multiple nodes. The library connects all the nodes sending/receiving XML data using the same XML schema to one group. The data is also validated by the schema during the send and receive process.

@* @*
libpackedobjectsd is based on libpackedobjects, libxml2 and ZeroMQ and therefore should run on any system that libxml2 and ZeroMQ runs on.

@section Installing packedobjectsd
@cindex Installing packedobjectsd

To install from the latest source:
@smallexample
git clone git://gitorious.org/packedobjectsd/packedobjectsd.git
cd packedobjectsd
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
@end smallexample

@section Quick start
@cindex Quick start

After compiling and running 'make check' you should find a binary called 'packedobjectsdtest' in your src directory. This is command-line tool built with packedobjectsd which you can use to test out sending and receiving:
@*
@smallexample
$ ./packedobjectsdtest --help
usage: packedobjectsd --schema <file> --xml <file> 
@end smallexample
@noindent
To send and receive run:
@*
@smallexample
$ ./packedobjectsdtest --schema foo.xsd --xml foo.xml
@end smallexample

@section API basics
@cindex API basics

There are only 4 main function calls which are made available by adding @code{#include <packedobjectsd/packedobjectsd.h>} to your code.
@smallexample
packedobjectsdObject *packedobjectsd_init(const char *schema_file);

int send_data(packedobjectsdObject *pod_obj, xmlDocPtr doc);

xmlDocPtr receive_data(packedobjectsdObject *pod_obj);

void packedobjectsd_free(packedobjectsdObject *pod_obj);

@end smallexample
@noindent
You first must initialise the library using your XML Schema. Typical use would be one called to init_packedobjects at startup and then multiple calls to encode/decode based on your protocol. The interface to the packedobjects_encode function requires a libxml2 doc type. The packedobjects_decode function returns a libxml2 doc type.
    
If during runtime your schema changed you must call the init function again with the new file. The library is designed to do preprocessing of the schema during the init function which then allows efficient encoding and decoding plus validation to take place. Therefore, do not call init_packedobjects more than once if you do not plan on supporting dynamically changing protocols at runtime.

To build an application with the software you must link with the library. Using autoconf you can add @code{PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBPACKEDOBJECTS], [libpackedobjects])} to your configure.ac file and then use the variables @code{$(LIBPACKEDOBJECTS_CFLAGS)} and @code{$(PACKEDOBJECTS_LIBS)} in your Makefile.am file.
